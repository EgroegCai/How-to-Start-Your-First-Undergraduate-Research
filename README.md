# Overview

Conducting a research project requires time commitment and responsibilities. Before getting started, be sure to talk to your academic advisor and make a reasonable schedule. 

# Find A Research Supervisor

* **If you would like to do research either within or outside your own department, take a look at the faculty page on the department’s website.** Usually faculty members list their research interest out on their personal page. You could also read the titles of their most recent publications to get a sense of what they are up to.

* (Optional) **If your research topic is potentially multi- or interdisciplinary (e.g. linguistics, public policy, logic), you could also explore multiple departmental websites, perhaps even outside your own college.** For example, there are faculty members with primary research interest in formal logic in all of School of Computer Science, Department of Mathematical Sciences, and Department of Philosophy.

* **Consider instructors of courses that you really enjoyed.** It is likely that your research interest would align with theirs. Having enjoyed the course could also mean that you have compatible personalities and work ethics, which are no less important than having similar research interests.

* **Contact your academic/faculty advisor.** They often know the type of research going on in both your department and other departments in your college, so you can get valuable advice on which faculty may be a good fit as your research supervisor. They can also introduce you to faculty members or other advisors (if it turns out your department does not have the appropriate research resource for you).

* **Talk to fellow students who are already involved in research with a faculty.** They could provide useful feedback about a faculty’s research area, as well as their personality, work style, and expectations for a student researcher.
